This workshop will introduce the R programming language, popular in the field of biologging.

We will explore some of the popular software packages suitable for exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data, including `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, for the purpose of generating summaries for reports.

The workshop will be followed by a discussion regarding the use of Github for code management and scoping any future report summaries to include in the code.
