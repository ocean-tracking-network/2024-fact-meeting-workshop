## Other required reporting metrics

The Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) supports global telemetry research by providing training, equipment, and data infrastructure to our large network of partners. 

OTN and affiliated networks provide automated cross-referencing of your detection data with other tags in the system to help resolve "mystery detections" and provide detection data to taggers in other regions. OTN's Data Managers will also extensively quality-control your submitted metadata for errors to ensure the most accurate records possible are stored in the database. OTN's database and Data Portal website are excellent places to archive your datasets for future use and sharing with collaborators. We offer pathways to publish your datasets with OBIS, and via open data portals like ERDDAP, GeoServer etc. The data-product format returned by OTN is directly ingestible by analysis packages such as glatos and resonATe for ease of analysis. OTN offers support for the use of these packages and tools.

Please contact **OTNDC@DAL.CA** if you are interested in connecting with your regional network and learning about their affiliation with OTN.

##  Using Github

This set of workshop material is directed at researchers who are ready to begin the work of acoustic telemetry data analysis. The first few lessons will begin with introductory R - no previous coding experince required. The workshop material progresses into more advanced techniques as we move along, beginning around lesson 8 "Introduction to Glatos". 

If you'd like to refresh your R coding skills outside of this workshop curriculum, we recommend [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/ "Website for R ecology lesson") as a good starting point. Much of this content is included in the first two lessons of this workshop.
